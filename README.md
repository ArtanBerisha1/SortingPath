# Sorting Path App
- Idea of the app is to visualize sorting algorithms, similar with implementations on web 

List of sorting algorithms to implement/implemented:
- [x] Bubble Sort
- [x] Insertion Sort
- [x] Selection Sort
- [x] Heap Sort (more work is needed)
- [x] Merge Sort (more work is needed)
- [ ] Quick Sort (TODO)

### TODOs: 
- **Bugfix**: UI bug after Process Button is clicked 
- **Bugfix**: Clicking Process Button while we are sorting removes drawings
- **Feature**: Check if the array is sorted before sorting
- **Feature**: UX -> hide Sort and Select buttons and show them after Process is clicked
- Publish App on play store
- **Feature**: Add flowcharts for the algorithms
- **Bugfix**: Implement correctly Heap Sort and Merge Sort
- **Feature**: Implement Quick Sort
