# Sorting Path App
- Idea of the app is to visualize sorting algorithms, similar with some implementations that I saw on web 

![screen-gif](sortAppPrev.gif)

List of sorting algorithms to implement/implemented:
- [x] Bubble Sort
- [x] Insertion Sort
- [x] Selection Sort
- [x] Heap Sort (more work is needed)
- [x] Merge Sort (more work is needed)
- [ ] Quick Sort (TODO)

### TODOs: 
- **Bugfix**: ~~UI bug after Process Button is clicked~~
- **Bugfix**: ~~Clicking Process Button while we are sorting removes drawings~~
- **Feature**: ~~Check if the array is sorted before sorting~~
- **Feature**: Add flowcharts for the algorithms [In progress]
- **Bugfix**: Implement correctly Heap Sort and Merge Sort
- **Feature**: Implement Quick Sort
- Publish App on play store
